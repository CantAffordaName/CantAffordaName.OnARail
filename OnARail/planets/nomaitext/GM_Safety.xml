    <Text>I was just mining this pillar for resources to build the train when I discovered that there was an aquifer right above me.</Text>

    <Text>...And, of course, shortly thereafter the entire upper portion of the pillar broke! I was unharmed, but a little shaken being pushed around by the ensuing flood.</Text>

    <Text>After coming to my senses, I realized I was standing in patch of <![CDATA[<color=lightblue>Ghost Matter</color>]]>! ...But I wasn't writhing in burning agony?</Text>

    <Text>Not too long after being bewildered by this, it <![CDATA[<i>very much started to burn</i>]]>, as most come to expect. But why did it take so long to start hurting me?</Text>

    <Text>It seems I have accidentally discovered a means to achieve temporary immunity to the effects of <![CDATA[<color=lightblue>Ghost Matter</color>]]>. By being completely drenched with water, I can freely touch it without worry.</Text>

    <Text>Frankly, I'm still going to be anxious standing in a cloud of <![CDATA[<color=lightblue>Ghost Matter</color>]]> considering all that's between me and certain death is soggy garments.</Text>

    <Text>Further testing shows that I have about <![CDATA[<color=orange>one minute</color>]]> after climbing out of water to use my newfound invincibility before I dry off.</Text>
