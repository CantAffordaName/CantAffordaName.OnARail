    <Text>I have found some things they left behind. Materials, mostly. It's quite a boon! The less resources I have to gather, the faster I can get this done.</Text>

    <Text>I should note that I have also found two pairs of warp cores lying around. This is excellent because my first idea for getting to the other planets was just going to be flinging myself to them when the orbits align.</Text>

    <Text>If I had the time or the means to reach it, perhaps I could <![CDATA[<color=orange>get more cores</color>]]> from the <![CDATA[<color=orange>derilict vessel</color>]]>. They built this warp reciever on this planet, after all.</Text>

    <Text><![CDATA[<color=orange>Update</color>]]>: I'm going to deconstruct the warp reciever here and move it onto the train. For now it'll just lead to the <![CDATA[<color=orange>vessel</color>]]> (not that I can get there anyways), but I'll be able to make use of it eventually!</Text>
