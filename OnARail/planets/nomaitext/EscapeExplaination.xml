    <ParentID>1</ParentID>
    <Text>With that said, I'm surprised that Nomai tech was <![CDATA[<i>already</i>]]> here before I showed up. Well, maybe not. Our clans are everywhere.</Text>
  </TextBlock>
  <TextBlock>
    <ID>3</ID>
    <ParentID>2</ParentID>
    <Text>I was worried that someone might show up and start asking questions, but it would seem that no one's around this particular star.</Text>

    <ParentID>3</ParentID>
    <Text>Upon further inspection, there seems to be a <![CDATA[<color=orange>derelict vessel</color>]]> in the distance... Did something happen to this particular clan?</Text>
  </TextBlock>
  <TextBlock>
    <ID>5</ID>
    <ParentID>4</ParentID>
    <Text>Surely we would have heard about something like that. It's not every day a clan chooses to abandon a <![CDATA[<color=orange>vessel</color>]]>.</Text>
  </TextBlock>
  <TextBlock>
    <ID>6</ID>
    <ParentID>5</ParentID>
    <Text>...Well, perhaps <![CDATA[<i>I</i>]]> might relate to that last bit.</Text>
  </TextBlock>
  <TextBlock>
    <ID>7</ID>
    <ParentID>6</ParentID>
    <Text>Anyways, I've covered my tracks to the best of my ability. For now I'll rest and in the morning my project begins.</Text>
