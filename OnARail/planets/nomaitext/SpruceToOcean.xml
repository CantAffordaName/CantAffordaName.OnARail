		<Text>I'm in the process of sealing off <![CDATA[<color=orange>Locomocean's refinery</color>]]> and I brought a core by leaping to the planet. I hit a patch of land. On an ocean planet. Not quite the <![CDATA[<i>splash</i>]]> I was hoping to make (Ha ha. I'm in pain).</Text>

    <Text>Now, I didn't break anything... I think. But I lost grip of the core and I'm not about to go back to swimming with the fishies to find it. I'll grab another core to use instead.</Text>

    <Text>If I had to guess where it was? Based on the ocean current, probably the <![CDATA[<color=orange>South Pole</color>]]>. But I'm not about to go digging in the sand because A) I hate sand, and B) I hate the fish.</Text>
