    <Text>I wish <![CDATA[<color=orange>Spruce Caboose</color>]]> had a spacious spot, but I can't really refine <![CDATA[<color=lightblue>Ghost Matter</color>]]> while being so close to the train.</Text>

    <Text>I have scouted the waters and located the perfect spot to build a <![CDATA[<color=orange>refinery</color>]]>: a spacious cavern. The fish here don't seem to be interested in it. I can at least have some sanctity within.</Text>

    <Text><![CDATA[<color=orange>Update #2</color>]]>: I went ahead and sealed off the cavern completely. Sand kept getting in through the airlock and it's less frustrating to just use some standard warp cores to get in and out.</Text>
