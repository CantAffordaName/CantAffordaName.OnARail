    <Text>Ever since my younger days when no one appreciated my talk of space trains being the next big thing for Nomai-kind, I've been planning to get away from my clan to build it all myself.</Text>

    <Text>I knew it could be done. I simply needed planets that were small enough with at least one with a potent energy source.</Text>

    <Text>After identifying this system as my target destination, I quietly hijacked one of the escape pods from my <![CDATA[<color=orange>vessel</color>]]>, I managed to leave undetected.</Text>

    <Text>To prevent my clan from finding and stopping me before I finish construction, I've set up this One-Way beacon. It'll make it harder for them to track me down and it'll still let me get back to them once I finish the train's warp functionality.</Text>
